# What is this?

This is a small Bash Script project I created with some assistance from a colleague. It can perform routine tasks in a simplified selection rather than a command.

* The script uses  the 'select' menu creator (built into BASH).
* 'While' loops allow the user to return to the menu after creating tasks.

# How I worked on this project

* With some internet research, I created this simple script in an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine.
* I created the mock scenario where this script would be used.
* I planned out the script functions and created the appropriate menu selections.

# Why I built the project this way

* After trying different methods to create a simple menu in BASH, I found 'select' to be the most straightforward.
* I followed the instructions of a grading rubric to meet the project requirements.
* I used loops and breaks so the script could function indefinitely.

# If I had more time I would change this

* I would research common Linux functions outside of what was required for this project and add them to the list.
* I would look online for inspiration from current Linux System Administrators to build more useful, efficient, and automated scripts.
